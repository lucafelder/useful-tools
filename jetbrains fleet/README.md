# Jetbrains Fleet

## Introduction
Fleet is a new (as of 2024) IDE for "any language". This IDE is free during the public review.

I came across it while searching for a handy application (besides vs code is mostly "occupied" by a latex document)
to edit markdown files in this collection.

## Configuration
Fleet is configured through a gui but the gui is more or less adding options to json configuration file.

The configuration file is located at `~/.fleet/settings.json`.
The unspoilt and my config file can be found in this directory.

### Changed configurations
-> Settings
- General
  - Theme: sync with os (change theme according to os settings)
  - Autosave: Off (do not autosave, use `CMD + S` instead)
- Appearance
  - Visual Guides Position (add a line at 120 characters)
